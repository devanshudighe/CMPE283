## Division of Work:

###   1. Devanshu Dighe : (Email : devanshu.dighe@sjsu.edu, Student ID: 014608347)
Collaboratively completed the functionality and code changes in the vmx.c and cpuid.c emulation functions. I worked mainly on the cpuid.c file to calculate the number of exits. 

__Steps__: 
1) Installed VMware Workstation on my Windows machine and set up an outer VM with Linux OS.
2) I referred to the code segment from Assignment-2 to update the emulation code in cpuid.c.
3) In the vmx.c file under the function vmx_handle_exit, to calculate the number of exits for each exit type, I created a variable which will increment after an exit is encountered. This is an array of size 69 which is the total number of exits defined in the SDM.
5) This was performed considering a single CPU. To make it thread safe and concurrent on multiple CPU's I added the atomic variables that helps in achieving concurrent values of cycle times on multiple CPUs. 
6)Created a leaf function 0xFFFFFFE in which my task was to find out the number of exits that are defined in the SDM as well as defined in the KVM under the function kvm_handle_exit. 
6) Tested the program on an inner VM which was also VMware Workstation. Installed a package called CPUID that helps us testing the functionality using the command **cpuid -l 0x4FFFFFFE -s [exit number]**
             

###   2. Sumeet Deshpande (Email: sumeetsuhas.deshpande@sjsu.edu, Student Id: 014608334)
Worked in tandem with my team member to implement the features required by the assignment. Worked primarily on the cpuid.c and vmx.c to enable the system to respond with the number and frequency of exits of each type when the cpuid leaf function is called.

__Steps__:
1) Worked on a dual booted machine with Ubuntu 18.04 installed in it.
2) Referred the assignment to follow the steps required for building the Kernel to the latest version.
3) Understood where to make code changes required for the assignment from Video 5. (Assignment 2)
4) Made changes in the vmx_handle_exit function of the vmx.c file to calculate the number of exits by using the atomic_inc function. Atomic variables were used to make the system concurrent. The atomic variable was initialized in cpuid.c and exported in vmx.c using the export_symbol function. 
5) Added the leaf function 0x4FFFFFFE in the cpuid.c file in the kvm_emulate_cpuid function. I wrote the code for setting the register values for the exit types that are not present in SDM and not present in KVM.
6) Ran a for loop to find the number of exits for each exit types.
6) Tested the program by using an inner VM using the virt-manager and qemu. The nested VM was installed using an ISO file. Installed the cpuid package to test the functionality with the command mentioned in the assignment.


## Questions
3) Comment on the frequency of exits â€“ does the number of exits increase at a stable rate? Or are there more exits performed during certain VM operations? Approximately how many exits does a full VM boot entail?
The number of exits do increase after subsequent runs of the CPUID leaf function and at a stable rate.
There are approximately 5.6 million exits in a full VM boot.

4) Of the exit types defined in the SDM, which are the most frequent? Least?
  - Most Frequent Exit Types : 
    30 (IO Instruction), 28 (Control Register Accesses)
    
  - Least Frequest Exit Types : 
    29 (MOV DR), 54 (WBINVD)
