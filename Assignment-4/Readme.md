## Division of Work:

###   1. Devanshu Dighe : (Email : devanshu.dighe@sjsu.edu, Student ID: 014608347)
I researched the behaviour of exits that were happening when EPT was not 0. 
             

###   2. Sumeet Deshpande (Email: sumeetsuhas.deshpande@sjsu.edu, Student Id: 014608334)
I researched the behaviour of exits that were happening when EPT was set to 0. 

### Steps: (Same as assignment 3)


## Questions
1) Include a sample of your print of exit count output from dmesg from “with ept” and “without ept”.
  - With EPT
  ![alt text](https://github.com/devanshudighe/CMPE283/blob/main/Assignment-4/With_EPT.png "With ept")

  - Without EPT
  ![alt text](https://github.com/devanshudighe/CMPE283/blob/main/Assignment-4/Without_EPT.png "without ept")

2) What did you learn from the count of exits? Was the count what you expected? If not, why not?
     
    
3) What changed between the two runs (ept vs no-ept)?
