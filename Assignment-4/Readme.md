## Division of Work:

###   1. Devanshu Dighe : (Email : devanshu.dighe@sjsu.edu, Student ID: 014608347)
I researched the behaviour of exits that were happening when EPT was not 0. 
             

###   2. Sumeet Deshpande (Email: sumeetsuhas.deshpande@sjsu.edu, Student Id: 014608334)
Worked in tandem with my team member to implement the features required by the assignment. Worked primarily on the cpuid.c and vmx.c to enable the system to respond with the number of exits and cycle times of the exits when the cpuid leaf function is called.
__Steps__:



## Questions
2) Include a sample of your print of exit count output from dmesg from “with ept” and “without ept”.
  - With EPT

  - Without EPT
  ![alt text](https://github.com/devanshudighe/CMPE283/blob/main/Assignment-4/Without_EPT.png "without ept")

3) What did you learn from the count of exits? Was the count what you expected? If not, why not?
4) What changed between the two runs (ept vs no-ept)?
